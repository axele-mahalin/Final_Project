# Art exhibitions recommender

# Description

My project aims to revolutionize the way art enthusiasts discover and experience exhibitions by providing a personalized art exhibitions recommender in Paris.

Paris has a lot of museums and art exhibitions to offer, but based on my personal experience, navigating the vast art world can be overwhelming, with countless exhibitions taking place simultaneously in different locations.
This is the reason why I thought it could be interesting to simplify the process of discovering and experiencing art exhibitions and develop a machine learning model using NLP techniques to recommend art exhibitions based on specific criteria such as the genre of the exhibitions: contemporary art, street-art, history, photography, etc.

Having explained the end goal, my project is not only limited to the machine learning model but also involves finding and cleaning data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization, creating a database entity relationship diagram, setting up the database, and querying data from it to progress through my end goal.
